                    <h3> Candace Hurman</h3>
                    <p>Mermaids and Tadpoles was created by Candace Hurman. She has been happily married for almost 14 years and has two sons, ages 9 & 13. While she works full-time in the Healthcare industry, in her spare time she is devoted to teaching kids a new love for swimming. Mermaids and Tadpoles was inspired from her eternal love of the water from a young age. 
                    </p>
                    <p> Candace has an extensive swimming background. She swam competitvely for 12 years winning accolades like All- American Swimmer in High school. She eventually went on to college where she continued to swim for a DII school and was a Top 10 finalist throughout her swimming career. Post college she never strayed far from the pool and worked as a Lifeguard for 5 years. Since her formative years, she continues to teach swim leassons and coach for nearly 30 years. Her passion for the water is unmatched and her hopes to share that with young guppies, is what keeps her inspired everyday.             
                    </p>
                    <p> Hurman's #1 lesson philosophy is water safety! Your child's swimming journey will be flexible with their individual strengths and needs. This allows children the space to grow and learn within the water while instructors gain their trust. We can't wait to get started and jump in the water!!
